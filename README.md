# cross-section-wenu

This is an analysis of the W boson into an electron (or a positron) and a neutrino, performed using data from the CMS experiment at CERN. The data can be found 
here: [http://opendata.cern.ch/record/545](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/545) (the Wenu.csv file). The purpose of the analysis was to find distriutions of multiple variables, use them to reduce the background
events (events recorded by the detector which are not $W \rightarrow e + \nu$ decays) and calculate this decay channel cross section for proton-proton collisions. 
The analysis was part of my annual assignment during my second year of undergraduate studies in Physics.

### Data

The data file consists of recorded events along with their physical quantities described on the website where it can be downloaded (the link above).

### References
This whole analysis was based on an article published by the CMS group: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4789](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4789).
